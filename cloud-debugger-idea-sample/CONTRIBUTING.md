# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

Please note: this servlet is a *deliberately buggy* example 
used for teaching the use of a debugger.
We will not accept patches that fix the bugs intended to be discovered
by students following along with the tutorial.

Furthermore, the application is deliberately small, simple, and self-contained.
It is designed to illustrate certain very specific points.
We will not accept patches that add features or otherwise 
productionize this code if that compromises its use as an example.
This is not intended to be production code.

However, if for some reason you find this code useful in your own work,
you are more than welcome to fork it into your own repository under the
terms of the license and develop it further there.

With that said, if you still want to submit a patch:


## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we
have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA]
    (https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA]
    (https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to
accept your pull requests.
